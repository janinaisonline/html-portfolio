<h1>The best movies according to myself</h1>
<h2>My favorite movies</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>Well, this is a very obvious choice. Great actors. I love sci-fi movies, especially with a creative idea behind it. <br/>
    The question for the red or the blue pill, iconic... <br/>
    Young Keanu Reeves, iconic...</p>
<h3>Ponyo</h3>
<p>Definitly one of my favorite childhood movies. Ghibli studio produced some of the nicest animated movies made to this day. The attention to detail and the beauty of its drawings is fascinating. Ponyo is a touching story with a happy ending.</p>
<h3>Lord of the rings</h3>
<p>Another obvious choice, this is. The whole trilogy is famous for its special effects and its scenery at an early stage of this generation of movie making. Heartfelt storyline with the little hobbit Frodo saving all of Middle-Earth. An absolute classic and must-seen if in anyway interested in movies.</p>
